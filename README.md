# Data Science - IT 362

In this data science project, we gathered data from the YouTube API and analyzed the CrashCourse YouTube channel to predict the number of views a video can receive. We built a comprehensive set of regression models to understand why some videos perform better than others and to spot trends that can help boost views.
